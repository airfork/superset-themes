# Project Status

## Current State

The repo contains a Task 4 Vite/React/TypeScript static app checkpoint on branch
`feature/theme-catalog-app`. The reusable preview surface system is implemented
and ready for Task 5 catalog integration.

Latest completed checkpoint:

- Task 1 scaffold added: package scripts, pnpm workspace/lockfile, Vite config, Vitest config, Biome config, app entry point, routed catalog shell, neutral global styles, and `scripts/check.mjs`.
- Focused app-shell smoke test added in `src/app/App.test.tsx`.
- Task 1 review remediation added runnable Playwright, Storybook, browser-install, and theme utility scaffolds so exposed scripts do not fail before later tasks fill in deeper behavior.
- Task 2 theme core added Zod runtime schemas, TypeScript theme/catalog types, export-clean theme JSON behavior, original Aurora light/dark and Graphite dark fixtures, catalog metadata, fixture lookup helpers, and real catalog validation.
- Task 3 theme utilities added pure WCAG contrast checks, structured contrast warnings, a real catalog contrast CLI, and pure preview CSS variable mapping for UI and terminal tokens.
- Task 4 preview surface system added: neutral inspector chrome, accessible tabs, controlled/uncontrolled selected-tab support, themed preview frame, Superset-aligned workspace/editor/terminal/diff/command/settings surfaces, Storybook stories, and component tests.
- Task 4 design critique remediation kept the catalog chrome outside theme variables, added agent preset/context lanes, improved mobile containment, replaced fake search/command/form semantics with real controls where practical, and added cursor/search-highlight samples.
- Design spec committed in `8b05d03`.
- Implementation planning and handoff docs drafted after that checkpoint.
- Private GitHub repo created at `git@github.com:airfork/superset-themes.git`.

## Active Plan

- [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-superset-theme-catalog-implementation.md](superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-superset-theme-catalog-implementation.md)

## Next Step

Start Task 5: build catalog search, filters, compact cards, and theme detail view. Reuse `src/preview/PreviewTabs.tsx`, `src/preview/PreviewFrame.tsx`, and `src/preview/surfaces.tsx`; do not fork preview logic into catalog-specific copies.

## Resumability Protocol

After each meaningful implementation checkpoint:

1. Update the active plan checkboxes.
2. Update this file with current state, next step, verification run, and blockers.
3. Commit coherent completed work.

## Verification

Latest app verification:

- `pnpm test -- src/app/App.test.tsx` passed.
- `pnpm test:unit -- src/theme-core/schema.test.ts src/theme-core/exportTheme.test.ts` first failed on missing Task 2 modules, then passed after schema/export/catalog implementation.
- `pnpm themes:validate` passed: 3 catalog themes from 3 JSON files validated.
- `pnpm check` passed: Biome check, TypeScript check, Vitest run, and Vite production build.
- `pnpm test:e2e` passed after adding Playwright scaffold coverage.
- `pnpm test:stories` passed after adding Storybook Vitest scaffold coverage.
- `pnpm test:unit` passed for 5 test files and 11 tests after Task 3.
- `pnpm themes:check-contrast` passed: 3 catalog themes checked across 7 contrast pairs each.
- `pnpm check` passed: Biome check, TypeScript check, Vitest run, and Vite production build.
- `pnpm themes:generate` still runs as a scaffold command until its implementation task replaces it.
- `pnpm browsers:install` installed Chromium for local Playwright and Storybook browser tests.
- `pnpm test:unit -- src/preview/PreviewTabs.test.tsx` passed for Task 4 preview tab behavior and frame CSS variable mapping.
- `pnpm test:stories` passed for Task 4 preview stories.
- `pnpm check` passed for Task 4: Biome check, TypeScript check, Vitest run, and Vite production build.
- `npx impeccable detect src/preview src/ui src/styles/global.css` passed with no findings.
- Storybook visual inspection was performed at desktop and mobile viewport sizes for workspace dark and settings light preview states.
