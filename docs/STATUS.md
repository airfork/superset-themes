# Project Status

## Current State

The repo contains a Task 1 Vite/React/TypeScript static app scaffold on branch `feature/theme-catalog-app`.

Latest completed checkpoint:

- Task 1 scaffold added: package scripts, pnpm workspace/lockfile, Vite config, Vitest config, Biome config, app entry point, routed catalog shell, neutral global styles, and `scripts/check.mjs`.
- Focused app-shell smoke test added in `src/app/App.test.tsx`.
- Task 1 review remediation added runnable Playwright, Storybook, browser-install, and theme utility scaffolds so exposed scripts do not fail before later tasks fill in deeper behavior.
- Design spec committed in `8b05d03`.
- Implementation planning and handoff docs drafted after that checkpoint.
- Private GitHub repo created at `git@github.com:airfork/superset-themes.git`.

## Active Plan

- [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-superset-theme-catalog-implementation.md](superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-superset-theme-catalog-implementation.md)

## Next Step

Begin Task 2 by defining the theme schema, export cleanup behavior, fixture catalog, and theme validation script. Do not expand the Task 1 shell beyond scaffold needs.

## Resumability Protocol

After each meaningful implementation checkpoint:

1. Update the active plan checkboxes.
2. Update this file with current state, next step, verification run, and blockers.
3. Commit coherent completed work.

## Verification

Latest app verification:

- `pnpm test -- src/app/App.test.tsx` passed.
- `pnpm check` passed: Biome check, TypeScript check, Vitest run, and Vite production build.
- `pnpm test:e2e` passed after adding Playwright scaffold coverage.
- `pnpm test:stories` passed after adding Storybook Vitest scaffold coverage.
- `pnpm themes:validate`, `pnpm themes:check-contrast`, and `pnpm themes:generate` now run as scaffold commands until their implementation tasks replace them.
- `pnpm browsers:install` installed Chromium for local Playwright and Storybook browser tests.

## Blockers

None.
