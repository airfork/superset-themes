# Project Status

## Current State

The Superset Theme Catalog is a complete static React/Vite app for browsing, comparing, editing,
generating, validating, and exporting Superset-compatible themes. It currently ships 14 catalog
themes and is configured for GitHub Pages project hosting at `/superset-themes/`.

Previous committed checkpoint: `2a68fa2 refactor: align critical theme css mapping`.

Latest completed checkpoint:

- Pre-public readiness now uses Vite's `%BASE_URL%` placeholder for static shell install assets,
  so GitHub Pages builds resolve favicon, apple-touch icon, and manifest links under
  `/superset-themes/`.
- Public-facing repository docs no longer include the private SSH remote, and the repo now has
  contribution guidance, a security policy, issue templates, and a pull request template.
- Public launch polish added favicon/app/social-card SVG assets, web app manifest, robots/sitemap
  hints, and Open Graph/Twitter/canonical metadata in the static shell.
- Catalog assembly now joins theme metadata to theme JSON by `themeId` instead of array position.
- Featured and baseline theme IDs derive from catalog `featuredRank` / `baselineRank` metadata.
- Critical first-paint theme CSS reads the same runtime default focused theme as the app.
- `global.css` now acts as an ordered import manifest for split surface CSS files; style contract
  tests read the full CSS import graph.

## Active Work

- None. The bundle/repo-structure cleanup opportunities tracked from the audit have been handled.

## Verification

Current slice verification passed:

- `rtk git diff --check`
- `rtk pnpm check` passed: Biome checked 194 files with no warnings, Vitest passed 52 files /
  348 tests, script tests passed, 4 metadata/community tests passed, and the production build
  inside `check` succeeded.
- `rtk pnpm test:e2e` passed: 31 passed, 1 skipped.
- `rtk pnpm test:stories` passed: 9 files / 31 stories.
- `rtk pnpm build` passed; initial JS `368.66 kB` minified / `113.76 kB` gzip.
- `rtk pnpm build:pages` passed; Pages initial JS `368.69 kB` minified / `113.77 kB` gzip.

## GitHub Pages And Bundle Baseline

- `pnpm build:pages` builds with the `/superset-themes/` base path.
- Vite emits `404.html` as a GitHub Pages SPA fallback and `.nojekyll`.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` verifies and deploys the Pages artifact from `main`.
- Public metadata now targets `https://airfork.github.io/superset-themes/`.
- Pages build output now resolves shell install assets under `/superset-themes/`:
  `/superset-themes/favicon.svg`, `/superset-themes/apple-touch-icon.svg`, and
  `/superset-themes/site.webmanifest`.
- Current initial JS baseline:
  - normal build: `368.66 kB` minified / `113.76 kB` gzip
  - Pages build: `368.69 kB` minified / `113.77 kB` gzip

## Remaining Opportunities

- Choose and add a root `LICENSE` file before presenting this as open source.
- Optionally add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` once the project owner chooses the governance policy.

## Blockers

None.
